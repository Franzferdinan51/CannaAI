## Trichome Analysis Tutorial

### Video Script: "Perfect Harvest Timing with Trichome Analysis"

**Duration**: 8:00
**Audience**: Growers in flowering stage
**Objective**: Teach accurate trichome assessment for harvest timing

---

### Script Outline

#### Intro (0:00-0:30)

**[ON SCREEN: Close-up trichome shots]**

**Narrator**: "Harvest timing can make or break your grow. Too early, you lose potency. Too late, you get sleepy buds. Today I'll show you how to use trichome analysis to hit that perfect harvest window every time."

#### Scene 1: Why Trichomes Matter (0:30-1:30)

**[SCREEN: Animated trichome stages]**

**Narrator**: "Trichomes are the crystal-like resin glands on your buds. They change color as they mature, and that color tells us exactly when to harvest.

**Clear Trichomes** - Too early, THC is still forming
**Cloudy/Milky** - Peak THC, maximum potency
**Amber** - THC converting to CBN, more sedative effects"

**[SHOW: Trichome images with percentages]**

"The magic is in the percentages. Most growers aim for:
- 10-30% Amber for energetic, cerebral effects
- 30-50% Amber for balanced body and mind
- 50-70% Amber for heavy, sleep-inducing effects"

#### Scene 2: Equipment Setup (1:30-2:30)

**[SCREEN: USB microscope, phone, ring light]**

**Narrator**: "For accurate trichome analysis, you need proper equipment.

Minimum: 100x magnification
Recommended: 200x magnification

I use a USB microscope connected to my computer, but you can also use a smartphone with a clip-on macro lens."

**[DEMONSTRATE: Set up microscope]**

"Let's set this up:
1. Connect microscope to USB
2. Position plant on stable surface
3. Add ring light for even illumination
4. Turn on microscope"

**[SHOW: Microscope view on screen]**

"Look at that! Crystal clear trichomes."

#### Scene 3: Sample Collection (2:30-3:30)

**[SCREEN: Close-up of buds]**

**Narrator**: "Where you sample from matters. Choose buds from:

1. **Top canopy** - Receives most light
2. **Mid-level** - Representative of entire plant
3. **Avoid fan leaves** - No trichomes there
4. **Avoid very bottom** - Lower quality

Take samples from 3-5 different buds for accuracy."

**[DEMONSTRATE: Position microscope over bud]**

"Position the microscope over a resinous area. You want to see the trichome heads clearly."

**[SHOW: Focus adjustment]**

"Adjust focus until the trichome heads are sharp. See how they're crystal clear?"

**[CAPTURE: Take screenshot or photo]**

"Take the photo! We'll analyze this."

#### Scene 4: Submitting Trichome Analysis (3:30-5:00)

**[SCREEN: Trichome analysis form]**

**Narrator**: "Back in CultivAI Pro, select 'Trichome Analysis' instead of regular analysis.

**[UPLOAD: Trichome photo]**

"Upload your trichome photo, and now we need device information:

**Device ID**: microscope_001
**Label**: Dino-Lite AM3113
**Mode**: Microscope
**Resolution**: 1920x1080
**Magnification**: 200x

**Confidence**: 88% - very good for trichome analysis

**Trichome Distribution**:
- Clear: 15%
- Cloudy: 65%
- Amber: 20%
- Density: Heavy (excellent!)

**[POINT: Harvest readiness]**

"**Harvest Readiness**: Ready in 3-5 days
This is the prime harvest window!

**Why?**
65% cloudy trichomes means peak THC production
20% amber is just starting to appear
Perfect balance of potency and effects

The AI also analyzed image quality:
- **Image Quality**: Excellent
- **Focus Quality**: Sharp
- **Lighting**: Optimal
- **Magnification**: 200x - perfect"

**[SCROLL: Recommendations]**

"Recommendations:
1. Harvest within 3-5 days
2. Monitor daily - trichomes change fast
3. Prepare drying/curing space
4. Consider strain effects - this hybrid will have balanced cerebral and body effects"

#### Scene 6: Making the Call (7:00-8:00)

**[SCREEN: Calendar, countdown]**

**Narrator**: "Based on this analysis, I'm marking my calendar for harvest in 4 days.

Why 4 days?
- Trichomes are at peak potency now
- Will reach 30% amber in 4 days
- Perfect for the effects I want

Pro tip: Take trichome photos daily during peak season. They change quickly, and you want to catch that window!"
