## 2026-01-26 - Icon-Only Buttons and Chat Accessibility
**Learning:** Chat interface components often utilize icon-only buttons for visual compactness (e.g., Send, Remove Image) but frequently miss `aria-label` attributes, rendering them inaccessible to screen readers.
**Action:** Always verify `aria-label` presence when reviewing or creating icon-only buttons, especially in dense UI areas like chat inputs.
